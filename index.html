          <h3>Portfolio</h3>
          <p>
This website will serve as my portfolio, demonstrating my skills as a software designer and a front-end web developer. As I create more projects, I will display them here.
          </p>
          <p>
All of the source code from this website is available on <a href="https://github.com/mastapegs/portfolio_website">GitHub</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
          I have now started to get a grasp on using the AngularJS framework. A combined view of my progress using it (along with some basic Bootstrap CSS) will be available at my <a href="https://github.com/mastapegs/customerInformation.git">GitHub repository</a>.

          <h4>Game of Life Simulator</h4>
          <img src="img/GoL.png"></a>
          <p>
British mathematician John Horton Conway devised a cellular automaton known as The Game of Life. This is a simulator that runs his game. The game is made up of a 2d grid of cells which interact with their cellular neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonally). Each cell follows four rules:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Customer Information App</h4>
          <img src="img/customerInfo.png"></a>
          <p>
This page utilizes the AngularJS framework. It is a work in progress and is meant to be a single page web app that allows users to create, list, update, and delete customers.

          <h4>Coin Collector</h4>
          <img src="img/coin_collector.png"></a>
          <p>
This is a ASCII 2D coin collecting game. You control the player with the keyboard arrow keys and the game keeps track of your progress as you collect items on the game board. I used this project to practice using closures to create a private namespace for the scripts variables.

          <h4>Random Color Generator</h4>
          <img src="img/random_colors.png"></a>
          <p>
This is my <a href="random_colors/random_colors.html">Random Color Generator</a>. It generates random colors based on random values for hue, saturation, and lightness. The user interface has three columns. The first column features random colors among every hue, the second column features warm hues, while the third column features cooler hues.

Here is the classic <a href="breakout/breakout.html">Breakout</a> game. Coded in pure JavaScript.

Dear beautiful,
        </p>
        <p>
It's been a while since I've done something creative for you. I don't have tooooo much creativity to offer, BUT... I HAVE been learning to make website. Why not make something devoted to you =]. 
        </p>
        <p>
Noah has been the center of our attention for the past 5 months. He deserves every drop of love that we can give him. He is perfect in every single way, no matter how often he keeps us up at night. He is handsome, learning so fast, and we could not have hoped for a better son.
        </p>
        <p>
With all the love we have been giving him, I have definitely not been sharing enough with you.... You deserve to be treated like a princess........ and your prince needs to deliver. I love you so much baby....
        </p>
        <p>
I still picture our lovely family taking trips to the city, walking through parks, enjoying and loving life. We need to start doing that =]. As Noah gets older, I can't wait to take you both through Boston, into the country side, to a cruise even! We live life only once, and I want us to start living... and loving every moment of it.
        </p>
        <p>
Starting now. I love you honey. I can't wait to enjoy every moment of life together with you.
